## Disclamer ‚ö†Ô∏è
- We're of course not responsible for any ban you recieve for using this bot.
- The captcha solver accuracy is only around 60% so please keep an eye on the bot.
- DO NOT run fishing and hunting in the same servers.
- Can run multiple accounts in the same channel (hunting and fishing in different servers) but all accounts must be whitelisted.
- You can only solve around 50 captchas (around 2 hours of grinding) until your AzCaptcha balance runs out! After that create a new AzCaptcha account and update the AzCaptcha Token in the config.
